- 👋 Hi, I’m @ybernaerts
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of neuroscience with machine learning.
- 🌱 Most of my work you can find in the lab I'm currently a PhD student at [here](https://github.com/berenslab). I’m currently digging into finding the best model parameters
      so that my model output gets close to what my experimental collaboraters actually observe. This involves resolving model misspeficiation.
- 💞️ You can always reach out to me if you'd like to know more on how to organize your data to do inference.
- 📫 You can reach me over dyfkebernaerts@hotmail.com .
