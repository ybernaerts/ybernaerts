- 👋 Hi, I’m @ybernaerts
- 👀 I’m interested in neuroscience, machine learning and crypto.
- 🌱 Most of my work you can find in the lab I'm currently a PhD student at [here](https://github.com/berenslab). I’m currently digging into finding the best model parameters
      so that my model output gets close to what my experimental collaboraters actually observe. This involves a
      a great deal of understadning when a neural network works how you'd like it to work.
- 💞️ You can always reach out to me if you'd like to know more on how to organize your data to do inference, or if you think I might be interested in helping you out building this
      new crypto project (but I'm just learning Solidity (!) ).
- 📫 You can reach me over yves.bernaerts@uni-tuebingen.de .
