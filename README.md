- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ybernaerts
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of Neuroscience with Machine Learning.
- ðŸŒ± PhD work was about cell typing, biophysical modeling, simulation-based inference and relating transcriptome with physiology in single cells
- ðŸŒ± Current PostDoc work is about neural dynamics and the role of individual neurons in neuronal population modelling
- ðŸ“« Interested? Reach me over yves.bernaerts@research.fchampalimaud.org .
